# Feature Extraction Project â€“ Countries & Anime Datasets

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates **feature extraction using Python and Pandas** on two datasets: **Countries** and **Anime**.  
The goal was to clean and transform the data, extracting useful features for further analysis.

Instead of listing every feature individually, all transformations are implemented in the notebooks so you can explore them directly.

## Datasets
1. **Countries Dataset:** Contains information about countries, regions, populations, etc.  
2. **Anime Dataset:** Contains information about anime shows, titles, episodes, genres, etc.  

---

## What the Project Does
- Extracts meaningful features from text columns (like `Title` or `country_long`) using Python code.  
- Demonstrates data preprocessing and transformation with **Pandas**.  
- Prepares the data for further analysis or downstream tasks.

---

## How to Explore
- Open the notebooks in **Jupyter Notebook** to see all feature extraction steps and explanations.

---

## Skills & Tools
- Python 3  
- Pandas for data manipulation  
- Feature extraction and data preprocessing from text columns  
- Working with multiple datasets efficiently  

---

## Next Steps
- Apply the extracted features for statistical analysis or machine learning projects.
